ideas :
understand events, tracks, info_data, stats
1. approached with simple cases like position of referee and the ball
2. data augmentation
3. realised that ball is not tracked all the time
4. corners are tracked 
5. closest events

possible ML approches tried:
1. single image based approaches: time stamp closest to the kick did not have a ball , the player was not closest to the corner
2. video_instance segmentation, multiview image based approach: felt it might be a overkill, (window size might be hard to set, the ball sometimes goes missing for around 1000 frames around corner kicks)
3. approach it as a tabular problem and solve with decision tree, using gradient boosting
    1. feature selection intiution: 
        1.ball is crucial
        2.refreee position may be give a clue
        3.player location individually may not be the best approach, but a feature with net distance between players in e
        4.gravity metric distance from penalty spot
        5.first man last man, left most right most
        6.total people visible on field on both sides
    2.refree's whistle would have been very useful in some form as a feature
problems faced:
1. timezone alteration to find the closest frame to the corner kick
2. dataset balancing
3. corner setup time
4. selecting important features
